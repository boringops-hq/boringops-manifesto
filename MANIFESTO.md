## 1. [Consistency](/articles/pillar_1_consistency/)

Consistency means a system behaves the same every time instead of improvising whenever it feels like it. Drift is the slow rot that turns predictable work into archaeology. Without consistency, reliability becomes guesswork.

> *"Surprises are great for birthdays, not for production."*

## 2. [Simplicity](/articles/pillar_2_simplicity/)

Complexity is future pain pretending to be progress. Every unnecessary moving part becomes a new failure mode waiting for its moment. Simplicity is refusing to build what you cannot operate calmly.

> *"Complexity is not clever. It is how outages introduce themselves."*

## 3. [Resilience](/articles/pillar_3_resilience/)

Failure is normal and chaos is optional. A resilient system absorbs impact without turning it into an incident parade. Recovery should be boring, not heroic.

> *"If your system panics when reality shows up, it is not resilient."*

## 4. [Maintainability](/articles/pillar_4_maintainability/)

If understanding a system requires tribal knowledge, decay has already won. Fear of touching code is the clearest sign something is broken. Maintainability keeps systems aging without rotting.

> *"If one person can fix it, you do not have software. You have a hostage."*

## 5. [Transparency](/articles/pillar_5_transparency/)

A system that refuses to explain itself forces humans to invent mythology. Most incident time is wasted finding truth, not fixing failure. Transparency removes that tax.

> *"If the system will not tell the truth, the team will invent a lie."*

## 6. [Longevity](/articles/pillar_6_longevity/)

Everything built as temporary becomes permanent the moment it works. Short-lived systems are expensive ones pretending they will not age. Longevity prevents tomorrow from inheriting yesterday's shortcuts as doctrine.

> *"Temporary becomes legacy the moment it works."*

## 7. [Standards](/articles/pillar_7_standards/)

Ten ways to do one thing is not flexibility. It is entropy. Variance is where mistakes hide and velocity dies. Standards make coherence a default instead of a miracle.

> *"If everyone does it differently, chaos wins by default."*

## 8. [Trust](/articles/pillar_8_trust/)

A system you do not trust becomes a system nobody will touch. Predictability beats theoretical correctness every time. Trust is maintained through monotony, not optimism.

> *"A system you do not trust becomes a system you do not touch."*

## 9. [Stewardship](/articles/pillar_9_stewardship/)

Nothing stays boring unless someone actively protects it. Shortcuts grow when urgency outranks integrity. Stewardship is the political force that keeps drift from winning by default.

> *"Nothing drifts faster than the thing nobody defends."*
